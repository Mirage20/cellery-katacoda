Cellery images can be pushed and pulled from any container registry like Cellery Hub. This enables cells to be re-used.

The following `cellery push` command allows you to push your cell image to the Cellery Hub. You must have a Cellery Hub login for this to work.  
`cellery push <CELLERY_HUB_USERNAME>/hello-world-cell:1.0.0`

Congratulations, You have successfully deployed your first hello world Cell.  :)
